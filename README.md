## Description

The SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js command-line application that empowers freelance web developers to create simple logos for their projects. It prompts users to input text, text color, shape, and shape color. Based on the user's inputs, it generates an SVG logo file and saves it as `logo.svg`.
